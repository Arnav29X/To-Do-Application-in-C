### To-Do List Application in C (File-Based)
This program is a menu-driven To-Do List application written in C that allows users to manage tasks with permanent storage using files. Tasks are saved in a text file so they remain available even after the program exits.

**Features:**
- Add new tasks to a file
- View all tasks with automatic numbering
- Mark a task as completed ([ ] → [✓])
- Delete a specific task
- Uses safe file-handling with a temporary file approach to modify data

The program demonstrates key C concepts such as file handling, string manipulation, loops, conditional logic, and modular functions, making it a practical example of a real-world console application.
